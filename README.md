# 🌾 Bio-Decomposer Drone – Stubble Burning Solution

A web-based presentation of our drone innovation built to tackle the serious problem of stubble burning in India. Our solar-powered drone autonomously sprays PUSA bio-decomposer over crop residue, accelerating its decomposition and turning it into natural manure — helping reduce air pollution, improving soil health, and supporting farmers economically.
